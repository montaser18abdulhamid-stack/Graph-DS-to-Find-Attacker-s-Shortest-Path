# Graph-DS-to-Find-Attacker-s-Shortest-Path
Attack-graph demo using only graph data structures. Nodes represent hosts/users/services and edges represent attacker actions (phishing, logon, pivoting, etc.) with configurable costs. Dijkstra’s algorithm is used to identify the shortest/cheapest route to high-value asset nodes and to rank assets by exposure from a given entry point.
