# Security Policy

This repository is a **demo / educational** project.

## Reporting a vulnerability
If you believe you found a security issue in this repo:
- Open a GitHub issue with a clear description (no secrets / no private data).
- If the issue contains sensitive details, avoid posting them publicly and instead describe the impact at a high level.

## Scope
This code does not run as a network service and has no external dependencies, so the expected security risk is low.
